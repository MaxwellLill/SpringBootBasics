# SpringBootBasics


This repository is just a collection of things i've been working on in order to get more familiar with Spring. This spring boot application uses a H2 database for use with JDBC Template. It's goal is not to be a fantastic program but to illustrate some example use cases for spring annotations and Java concepts such as lambda's.
